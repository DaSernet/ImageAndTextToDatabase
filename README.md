# ImageAndTextToDatabase
Will soon convert image and text files in folders to a database structure. (SQL)

Currently this program is working for my specific database.

With the text tree hierarchy option it should make a text file with all your file paths that match your search criteria. Currently set to 001.txt.
An example of this output is the following:

C:/Users/User/Desktop/ImageAndTextToDatabase/0/1/2/3/info_ao-0046594-001.txt

C:/Users/User/Desktop/ImageAndTextToDatabase/0/1/2/5/info_ao-0046595-001.txt

C:/Users/User/Desktop/ImageAndTextToDatabase/0/1/2/2/info_ao-0046596-001.txt

If we then select the SQL option and select the generated first.txt file the program will read these paths and go to each designated .txt file one by one.

Adding more soon.
